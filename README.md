# Markov Chains: Campus Map

## How to Set Up and Run Code

This project runs without any input from the user. The program generates a schedule for a generic day in my life as a student at Bowdoin college. Time frames are not included. The schedules always begin and end in Harpswell apartments, which is where I live!

In addition to generating a typed schedule, the program also produces an image of the Bowdoin College Campus! A pin is included on the screen at every location I am expected to travel to, given the produced schedule.

## Paragraphs

Personally Meaningful:

This project is personally meaningful to me because it is very relevant to my day to day life. I think this was especially true when I created the weights for each location. There are some days I go exclusively to class and my dorm (I have a kitchen), and some days I eat all three meals in the dining halls. I even mixed the field locations in to account for frisbee practices. I think the pins popping up in the exact locations is really satisfying, and it would make it easier to describe my day to a family member who hasn't visited Bowdoin.

Challenged:

This pushed me outside my comfort zone by forcing me to learn an entirely new library and work with visuals. I think I went about learning mathplt very poorly, because I started with the example code, not knowing what every line in the program did. This made it very difficult to extrapolate into animated images. I wanted the pins to apear in their respective spots in the order that they appeared in the schedule. I tried very very hard to achieve this, and eventually settled on a non-animated map. I think in order to have my desired result, I needed to have used a different library, and this was not something I considered early on enough. This was an important challenge for me because even though I may have not achieved my initial goal, I learned a lot from my failure (and the many hours of trying to get animations to work) and next time I'll be able to choose the perfect library ahead of time.

Next Steps:

I'd love to get the animation working eventually. I've looked into ffmpeg a little and I think that could be a good place to start.

Creative??
I think there are creative applications for this particular project. I think you could expand the campus map and locations to include new ones, or new patters for a day, or to suggest new study spots, and more. However, in its current state I would not argue it is necessarily creative. It was fun to make though! And very satisfying.
